; --------- Charge Voltage limitation (affecting CVL) ---------
; Description: Limit max charging voltage (MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE * cell count) and switch from max voltage to float voltage (FLOAT_CELL_VOLTAGE * cell count)
;              after max voltage is reached for MAX_VOLTAGE_TIME_SEC. It switches back to max voltage after SoC is below SOC_LEVEL_TO_RESET_VOLTAGE_LIMIT
;              If LINEAR_LIMITATION_ENABLE is set to True then penalty voltages are applied
; Example: The battery reached max voltage of 55.2V and hold it for 900 seconds, the the CVL is switched to float voltage of 53.6V to don't stress the batteries.
;          Allow max voltage of 55.2V again, if SoC is once below 90%
; Charge voltage control management enable (True/False).

; -- Cell Voltages
; Description: Cell min/max voltages which are used to calculate the min/max battery voltage
; Example: 16 cells * 3.45V/cell = 55.2V max charge voltage. 16 cells * 2.90V = 46.4V min discharge voltage
MIN_CELL_VOLTAGE   = 2.90
; Max voltage can seen as absorption voltage

; NOTE: works only when LINEAR_LIMITATION_ENABLE = True
; More details can be found here: https://github.com/Louisvdw/dbus-serialbattery/issues/297#issuecomment-1327142635
; If the cell voltage reaches 3.48V, then reduce actual battery-voltage by 0.01V
; If the cell voltage goes over 3.6V, then the maximum penalty will not be exceeded
; There will be a sum of all penalties for each cell, which exceeds the limits
; NOTE: The first value of PENALTY_AT_CELL_VOLTAGE has to be at least MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE + the first value of PENALTY_BATTERY_VOLTAGE,
;       else the FLOAT_CELL_VOLTAGE is never set. Additionally the battery voltage has to reach max voltage and all cells has to be below penalty voltage to switch to float voltage.

; --------- Cell Voltage Current limitation (affecting CCL/DCL) ---------
; Description: Maximal charge / discharge current will be in-/decreased depending on min and max cell voltages
; Example: 18 cells * 3.55V/cell = 63.9V max charge voltage
;          18 cells * 2.70V/cell = 48.6V min discharge voltage
;          But in reality not all cells reach the same voltage at the same time. The (dis)charge current
