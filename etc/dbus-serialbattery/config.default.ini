; --------- Cell Voltages ---------
; Description:
;     Cell min/max voltages which are used to calculate the min/max battery voltage
; Example:
;     16 cells * 3.45V/cell = 55.2V max charge voltage. 16 cells * 2.90V = 46.4V min discharge voltage

; --------- SOC reset voltage ---------
; Description:
;     May be needed to reset the SoC to 100% once in a while for some BMS, because of SoC drift.
;     Specify the cell voltage where the SoC should be reset to 100% by the BMS.
;       - JKBMS: SoC is reset to 100% if one cell reaches OVP (over voltage protection) voltage
;     As you have to adopt this value to your system, I reccomend to start with
;     OVP voltage - 0.030 (see Example).
;       - Try to increase (add) by 0.005 in steps, if the system does not switch to float mode, even if
;         the target voltage SOC_RESET_VOLTAGE * CELL_COUNT is reached.
;       - Try to decrease (lower) by 0.005 in steps, if the system hits the OVP too fast, before all
;         cells could be balanced and the system goes into protection mode multiple times.
; Example:
;     If OVP is 3.650, then start with 3.620 and increase/decrease by 0.005
; Note:
;     The value has to be higher as the MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE
;     You also have to set CELL_VOLTAGES_WHILE_CHARGING accordingly, if you set CCCM_CV_ENABLE to true
;         else the charging current will be reduced to 0 before the target voltage is reached and the
;         battery will never switch to float
SOC_RESET_VOLTAGE = 3.650

;     day 16: soc reset reached twice
;     day 31: soc reset not reached since it's very cloudy

; --------- Cell Voltage limitation (affecting CVL) ---------
; This function prevents a bad balanced battery to overcharge the cell with the highest voltage and the bms to
; switch off because of overvoltage of this cell.
;
; Example:
;     15 cells are at 3.4v, 1 cell is at 3.6v. Total voltage of battery is 54.6v and the Victron System sees no reason to
;     lower the charging current as the control_voltage (Absorbtion Voltage) ist 55.2v
;     In this case the Cell Voltage limitation kicks in and lowers the control_voltage to keep it close to the MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE.
;
; In theory this can also be done with CCL, but doing it with CVL has 2 advantages:
;     - In a well balanced system the current can be kept quite high till the end of charge by using MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE for charging.
;     - In systems with MPPTs and DC-feed-in activated the victron systems do not respect CCL, so CVL is the only way to prevent the
;       highest cell in a bad balanced system from overcharging.
;
; There are 2 methods implemented to calculate CVL:
;   1. penalty_sum-Method (CVL_ICONTROLLER_MODE = False)
;      The voltage-overshoot of all cells that exceed MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE is summed up and the control voltage is lowered by this "penalty_sum".
;      This is calculated every LINEAR_RECALCULATION_EVERY seconds.
;      In fact, this is a P-Controller.
;   2. I-Controller (CVL_ICONTROLLER_MODE = True)
;      An I-Controller tries to control the voltage of the highest cell to MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE + CELL_VOLTAGE_DIFF_KEEP_MAX_VOLTAGE_UNTIL.
;      (for example 3.45V+0.01V =3.46V). If the voltage of the highest cell is above this level, CVL is reduced. If the voltage is below, CVL is
;      increased until cellcount*MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE.
;      An I-Part of 0.2 V/Vs (CVL_ICONTROLLER_FACTOR) has proved to be a stable and fast controlling-behaviour.
;      This method is not as fast as the penalty_sum-Method but usually smoother and more stable against toggeling and has no stationary deviation.

;     of 55.20 V is never reached and max voltage is kept forever.
