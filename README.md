# dbus-serialbattery
This is a driver for VenusOS devices (any GX device sold by Victron or a Raspberry Pi running the VenusOS image). 

The driver will communicate with a Battery Management System (BMS) that support serial communication (RS232, RS485 or TTL UART) and publish this data to the VenusOS system. The main purpose is to act as a Battery Monitor in your GX and supply State Of Charge (SOC) and other values to the inverter.
